Introduction
============

Dexterity-based default content types for Plone. This package is a drop-in
replacement for Products.ATContenttypes.  

.. note::

  This package will probably never become a part of Plone core. The archetypes
  content types in Plone will most likely be replaced by a generic Deco type in 
  the future. Deco is the new page composition tool that will probably become
  part of Plone 5. 

plone.app.contenttypes provides some default content-types that are extendable 
through-the-web. They aim to mimick the old default-types - the only change is that 
they are based on dexterity.
