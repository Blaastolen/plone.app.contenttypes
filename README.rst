Introduction
============

Dexterity-based default content types for Plone. This package is a drop-in
replacement for Products.ATContenttypes.

.. note::

  It is not clear yet if this package will become part of Plone core. The archetypes content types might be replaced by a generic Deco content type in
  the future.

plone.app.contenttypes provides default content-types (document, news item, file, etc.) that are extendable through-the-web. They aim to mimick the old
default-types - the only change is that they are based on dexterity.

.. note::

  For background information see the `initial discussion on the Plone developer
  mailinglist <http://plone.293351.n2.nabble.com/atcontenttypes-replacement-with-dexterity-td6751909.html>`_
